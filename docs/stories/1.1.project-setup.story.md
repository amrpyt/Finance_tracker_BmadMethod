# Story 1.1: Project Initialization and Core Dependency Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize the project structure with Next.js and install core dependencies,
**so that** we have a stable and correct foundation for building the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Next.js application is created and can be run locally.
2. Tailwind CSS is installed and configured.
3. Direct Supabase client is installed and configured to connect to the database.
4. A basic health-check API endpoint (`/api/health`) is created and returns a successful response.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Initialize Next.js Project (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create new Next.js application using `npx create-next-app@latest`
  - [x] Configure TypeScript support
  - [x] Verify the application runs locally on development server
  - [x] Test basic routing and pages functionality

- [x] Task 2: Install and Configure Tailwind CSS (AC: 2)
  - [x] Install Tailwind CSS dependencies
  - [x] Configure tailwind.config.js with proper content paths
  - [x] Set up CSS imports in globals.css
  - [x] Create a simple test component to verify Tailwind is working

- [x] Task 3: Install and Configure Supabase Client (AC: 3)
  - [x] Install Supabase client dependencies
  - [x] Configure DATABASE_URL in .env for Supabase connection
  - [x] Set up Supabase client configuration
  - [x] Test database connection

- [x] Task 4: Create Health Check API Endpoint (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create `/api/health` endpoint in Next.js API routes
  - [x] Implement basic health check response with status and timestamp
  - [x] Test endpoint returns successful JSON response
  - [x] Add basic error handling

- [x] Task 5: Project Structure Setup
  - [x] Create basic folder structure for components, lib, types
  - [x] Set up environment variables template (.env.example)
  - [x] Create basic README with setup instructions
  - [x] Initialize git repository if not already done

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story establishes the foundation for the **AI Personal Finance Tracker SaaS** WebApp. The system will be a Next.js application that integrates with internal AI APIs and uses Supabase as the database backend.

[Source: docs/architecture/1-system-overview.md]

### Tech Stack Requirements
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS for UI [Source: docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#frontend-webapp]
- **Database**: Supabase/Postgres with direct client integration [Source: docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#database-supabasepostgres]
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes for backend functionality [Source: docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#backend-api-layer]

### Database Connection
- Use direct Supabase client for database management (typed, direct SQL execution)
- This provides direct control and eliminates ORM complexity [Source: docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#implementation-note]

### API Endpoints Structure
The health check endpoint is the first of many API endpoints that will include:
- `/api/auth/*` → Login/Signup
- `/api/transactions/*` → CRUD for transactions  
- `/api/accounts/*` → Account management
- `/api/billing/*` → Stripe webhooks + subscription management
[Source: docs/architecture/4-api-endpoints-backend-frontend.md]

### Database Schema Preparation
While not implemented in this story, the database will contain these main tables:
- `users`, `accounts`, `transactions`, `subscriptions`
[Source: docs/architecture/3-database-schema.md]

### File Locations
- API routes: `/pages/api/` or `/app/api/` (depending on Next.js version)
- Components: `/components/`
- Database client: `/lib/database.ts`
- Environment variables: `.env.local`

### Testing Requirements
- Verify Next.js development server starts successfully
- Test Tailwind CSS styling works
- Confirm Supabase client can connect to database
- Validate health check endpoint returns proper JSON response

### Technical Constraints
- Use latest stable versions of Next.js, Tailwind, and Supabase client
- Ensure TypeScript support is properly configured
- Follow Next.js best practices for API routes and project structure

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Manual testing of development server startup
- Visual verification of Tailwind CSS functionality
- Database connection testing through Supabase client
- API endpoint testing using browser or curl
- No automated tests required for this foundational story
