## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Building on Story 2.1 implementation:

- Account management infrastructure already established [Source: Story 2.1 Dev Agent Record]
- AccountService class provides foundation for CRUD operations [Source: Story 2.1 File List]
- AccountCard component structure ready for enhancement [Source: Story 2.1 Implementation]
- Authentication and demo mode patterns established [Source: Story 2.1 Debug Log]

### Data Models

Account table structure: [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md]

```sql
accounts table:
- id (UUID, PK)
- user_id (FK → users.id)
- name (e.g. Bank, Cash, Visa)
- type (bank, cash, wallet, credit_card)
- balance (calculated)
- created_at
```

Transaction table for cascade deletion: [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md]

```sql
transactions table:
- id (UUID, PK)
- user_id (FK → users.id)
- account_id (FK → accounts.id)
- amount
- type (income/expense)
- category
- description
- date
- created_at
```

New interfaces needed:

```typescript
interface UpdateAccountRequest {
  name: string;
}

interface DeleteAccountResponse {
  deletedAccountId: string;
  deletedTransactionCount: number;
}
```

### API Specifications

New endpoints to be created: [Source: Story 2.1 patterns]

- `PUT /api/accounts/{id}` → Update account name for authenticated user
- `DELETE /api/accounts/{id}` → Delete account and cascade transactions
- Update request payload: `{ name: string }`
- Delete response format: `{ deletedAccountId: string, deletedTransactionCount: number }`

### Component Specifications

UI components to be updated: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

- **AccountCard**: Add edit/delete buttons and inline edit mode
- **EditAccountModal**: Optional modal for name editing (alternative to inline)
- **DeleteConfirmationModal**: Warning modal for account deletion
- **AccountsPage**: Handle edit/delete state and optimistic updates

### File Locations

Based on Next.js 15.5.3 App Router structure: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

- Extend API routes: `/src/app/api/accounts/[id]/route.ts` (new)
- Update components: `/src/components/accounts/AccountCard.tsx` (existing)
- New modals: `/src/components/accounts/DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx` (new)
- Update types: `/src/types/account.ts` (existing)
- Update service: `/src/lib/accounts.ts` (existing)

### Technical Constraints

- Next.js 15.5.3 with App Router compatibility [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Supabase PostgreSQL database integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- BetterAuth authentication for user context [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- TypeScript strict mode compliance [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Tailwind CSS for styling consistency [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Cascade Deletion Logic

Account deletion approach: [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md]

- Delete all transactions associated with account_id first
- Then delete the account record
- Return count of deleted transactions for user feedback
- Ensure deletion is atomic (use transactions if needed)
- Update account balance calculations for remaining accounts

### Testing Standards

Testing requirements for edit/delete functionality: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Test file location: `src/__tests__/components/accounts/` directory
- Use Jest and React Testing Library [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- API endpoint testing with mocked database
- User interaction testing for edit/delete flows
- Cascade deletion validation tests

Specific testing requirements for this story:

- Account name edit validation tests
- Delete confirmation modal tests
- Cascade deletion functionality tests
- API endpoint CRUD operation tests
- Optimistic UI update tests
