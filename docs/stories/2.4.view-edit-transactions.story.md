### Previous Story Insights
Building on Story 2.3 (Manual Transaction Addition) implementation:
- TransactionService with createTransaction method already established [Source: Story 2.3 Dev Agent Record]
- Transaction data models and API structure foundation ready [Source: Story 2.3 File List]
- Transaction form validation patterns established [Source: Story 2.3 Implementation]
- Account integration patterns proven successful [Source: Story 2.3 Completion Notes]
- Real-time balance update mechanisms implemented [Source: Story 2.3 Key Features]

### Data Models
Transaction table structure: [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md]
```sql
transactions table:
- id (UUID, PK)
- user_id (FK → users.id)
- account_id (FK → accounts.id)
- amount
- type (income/expense)
- category
- description
- date
- created_at
```

Required TypeScript interfaces:
```typescript
interface UpdateTransactionRequest {
  accountId?: string;
  amount?: number;
  type?: 'income' | 'expense';
  category?: string;
  description?: string;
  date?: string;
}

interface UpdateTransactionResponse {
  transaction: Transaction;
  updatedAccountBalance: number;
  previousAccountBalance?: number; // if account changed
}

interface DeleteTransactionResponse {
  deletedTransactionId: string;
  updatedAccountBalance: number;
}
```

### API Specifications
API endpoints to be implemented: [Source: architecture/4-api-endpoints-backend-frontend.md]
- `GET /api/transactions` → Retrieve all user transactions with filtering/sorting
- `PUT /api/transactions/:id` → Update existing transaction for authenticated user
- `DELETE /api/transactions/:id` → Delete transaction and update account balance
- Request validation: user ownership, valid account references, data integrity
- Response format: updated transaction data with balance impact

### Component Specifications
UI components to be created/updated: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **TransactionList**: Main list/table component with sorting and actions
- **TransactionListItem**: Individual transaction display with edit/delete buttons
- **EditTransactionForm**: Form component for transaction modification
- **DeleteTransactionModal**: Confirmation dialog for transaction deletion
- **TransactionsPage**: Main page component with navigation and state management

### File Locations
Based on Next.js 15.5.3 App Router structure: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- New page: `/src/app/transactions/page.tsx`
- API extensions: `/src/app/api/transactions/[id]/route.ts` (existing from Story 2.3)
- New components: `/src/components/transactions/TransactionList.tsx`
- New components: `/src/components/transactions/EditTransactionForm.tsx`
- New components: `/src/components/transactions/DeleteTransactionModal.tsx`
- Extended service: `/src/lib/transactions.ts` (existing from Story 2.3)
- Extended types: `/src/types/transaction.ts` (existing from Story 2.3)

### Technical Constraints
Technical requirements: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Next.js 15.5.3 with App Router compatibility
- React 19.1.0 functional components with hooks
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Tailwind CSS for styling consistency
- Supabase PostgreSQL for data operations
- BetterAuth for user authentication context

### Transaction List Requirements
Display and interaction specifications:
- **Sorting**: Default sort by date (newest first), support for multi-column sorting
- **Display Fields**: Date, amount, type, category, description, account name, actions
- **Actions**: Edit and Delete buttons for each transaction
- **Responsive Design**: Table view on desktop, card view on mobile
- **Loading States**: Skeleton components during data fetching
- **Empty States**: User-friendly message when no transactions exist
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for network or data issues

### Edit Transaction Requirements
Form and validation specifications:
- **Prefilled Values**: Load current transaction data into form
- **Validation Rules**: Same as creation form (amount > 0, required fields, etc.)
- **Account Changes**: Allow switching between user's accounts with balance updates
- **Type Changes**: Allow switching between income/expense with amount adjustment
- **Date Validation**: Prevent future dates, maintain reasonable date range
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with rollback on failure

### Delete Transaction Requirements
Confirmation and safety specifications:
- **Confirmation Modal**: Show transaction details before deletion
- **Safety Warnings**: Highlight balance impact and irreversible action
- **Account Balance Updates**: Real-time balance recalculation after deletion
- **Error Recovery**: Rollback UI state if deletion fails
- **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages after operation

### Balance Calculation Logic
Transaction modification impact: [Source: Story 2.3 Dev Notes]
- **Edit Operations**: Calculate difference between old and new amounts
- **Account Changes**: Remove from old account, add to new account
- **Type Changes**: Handle income ↔ expense conversions properly
- **Delete Operations**: Reverse original transaction impact on account balance
- **Atomic Updates**: Ensure transaction and balance changes are consistent

### User Experience Patterns
Navigation and interaction flows: [Source: docs/user-journey-flows.md]
- **Navigation Access**: Link from main dashboard and accounts pages
- **Filtering Options**: By account, date range, transaction type, category
- **Search Functionality**: Text search across description and category fields
- **Pagination Support**: Handle large transaction lists efficiently
- **Bulk Operations**: Future consideration for multi-select actions

### Testing Strategy
Test coverage requirements: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Component Tests**: TransactionList, EditTransactionForm, DeleteTransactionModal
- **API Tests**: PUT/DELETE endpoint validation with various scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: Complete edit/delete flows with database updates
- **User Interaction Tests**: Form submission, confirmation dialogs, error handling
- **Edge Cases**: Invalid data, network failures, concurrent modifications

### Performance Considerations
Optimization requirements: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Pagination**: Load transactions in chunks to handle large datasets
- **Memoization**: Use React.memo for transaction list items to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Loading States**: Progressive loading with skeleton components
- **Caching**: Consider client-side caching for frequently accessed data
- **Bundle Size**: Efficient component splitting for transactions page
