## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies

Building on Epic 2 foundation:

- Account management system from Stories 2.1 & 2.2 provides account selection infrastructure
- Authentication system from Epic 1 ensures user context for transactions
- Database schema includes transactions table with proper relationships
- AccountService patterns can be extended for TransactionService

### Data Models

Transaction table structure: [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md]

```sql
transactions table:
- id (UUID, PK)
- user_id (FK → users.id)
- account_id (FK → accounts.id)
- amount (decimal, positive for income, negative for expense)
- type (income/expense)
- category (string: food, transport, salary, etc.)
- description (text)
- date (timestamp)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

New TypeScript interfaces needed:

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  accountId: string;
  amount: number;
  type: 'income' | 'expense';
  category: string;
  description: string;
  date: string;
  createdAt: string;
}

interface CreateTransactionRequest {
  accountId: string;
  amount: number;
  type: 'income' | 'expense';
  category: string;
  description: string;
  date: string;
}

interface CreateTransactionResponse {
  transaction: Transaction;
  updatedAccountBalance: number;
}
```

### Transaction Categories

Common categories to implement: [Source: user-journey-flows.md]
**Expense Categories:** Food, Transportation, Entertainment, Shopping, Bills, Healthcare, Education
**Income Categories:** Salary, Freelance, Investment, Business, Gift, Other

### API Specifications  

New endpoint to be created:

- `POST /api/transactions` → Create new transaction for authenticated user
- Request payload: `CreateTransactionRequest`
- Response format: `CreateTransactionResponse` with updated account balance
- Validation: amount > 0, valid account ownership, required fields

### Component Architecture

Components to be created/updated: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

- **TransactionForm**: Main form component with validation
- **CategorySelector**: Dropdown/select for transaction categories  
- **AccountSelector**: Integration with existing account selection logic
- **TransactionTypeToggle**: Income/expense selection component
- **Modal/Page Integration**: Determine best UX pattern from user-journey-flows.md

### File Locations

Based on Next.js 15.5.3 App Router structure:

- New API route: `/src/app/api/transactions/route.ts`
- New components: `/src/components/transactions/TransactionForm.tsx`
- New types: `/src/types/transaction.ts`
- New service: `/src/lib/transactions.ts`
- Update existing: `/src/app/accounts/page.tsx` (integration)

### Form Validation Requirements

Transaction form validation rules:

- **Amount**: Required, positive number, max 2 decimal places
- **Type**: Required, must be 'income' or 'expense'
- **Category**: Required, must be from predefined list
- **Description**: Required, 3-100 characters
- **Date**: Required, cannot be future date, format: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Account**: Required, must be user's account

### UX Integration Points

Following user journey flows: [Source: user-journey-flows.md]

- Form accessible from dashboard and accounts page
- Clear visual feedback during submission
- Success confirmation with updated balance display
- Error handling with actionable messages
- Mobile-responsive form design

### Balance Calculation Logic

Transaction impact on account balances:

- **Income transactions**: Add amount to account balance
- **Expense transactions**: Subtract amount from account balance  
- **Real-time updates**: Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure
- **Consistency**: Ensure transaction creation and balance update are atomic

### Technical Constraints

- Next.js 15.5.3 with App Router compatibility [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Supabase PostgreSQL for transaction storage [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]  
- BetterAuth for user authentication context [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- TypeScript strict mode compliance [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Tailwind CSS for consistent styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Testing Strategy

Testing approach for manual transaction creation: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Unit Tests**: Form validation, API endpoint logic, service methods
- **Integration Tests**: Complete transaction creation flow with database
- **User Interaction Tests**: Form submission, error handling, success states
- **Edge Case Tests**: Invalid amounts, unauthorized access, network failures
