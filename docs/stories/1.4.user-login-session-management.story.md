## Dev Notes

### Implementation Approach
This story was implemented through the **BetterAuth Migration Epic** (Stories 2.1-2.3) which provided superior functionality beyond the original requirements:

**Original Plan**: Basic JWT-based login and session management
**Actual Implementation**: Advanced BetterAuth integration with enhanced security

### Previous Story Context
Built upon Story 1.3 (User Signup) which established:
- User registration functionality [Source: 1.3 implementation]
- Database user table structure [Source: 1.2 database schema]
- Basic authentication foundation [Source: 1.1 project setup]

### Enhanced Implementation Details
**BetterAuth Integration**: [Source: Stories 2.1-2.3 implementation]
- **Story 2.1**: BetterAuth infrastructure setup and database migration
- **Story 2.2**: Backend authentication system replacement with dual support
- **Story 2.3**: Frontend authentication integration with React client

### Data Models
User authentication data structure: [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md]
```sql
users table:
- id (UUID, PK)
- email
- password_hash (enhanced with BetterAuth scrypt)
- created_at

-- BetterAuth extensions added:
- sessions table for secure session management
- Enhanced password hashing with scrypt algorithm
```

### API Specifications
Authentication endpoints implemented: [Source: 2.2 backend implementation]
- `POST /api/auth/login` → Enhanced dual authentication login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` → Secure logout with session cleanup
- `GET /api/auth/me` → Session validation and user data retrieval
- `POST /api/auth/better-auth/*` → BetterAuth native endpoints

### Component Specifications
Frontend authentication components: [Source: 2.3 frontend implementation]
- Login page: `/src/app/login/page.tsx` - Enhanced with BetterAuth integration
- Auth context: `/src/contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Dual authentication support
- Protected routes: Automatic redirect and session validation
- Session management: BetterAuth useSession hook integration

### File Locations
Implementation files created: [Source: 2.1-2.3 file lists]
- **BetterAuth client**: `/src/lib/auth-client.ts`
- **Auth context**: `/src/contexts/auth-context.tsx`
- **Login page**: `/src/app/login/page.tsx`
- **Backend config**: `/src/lib/auth.ts` (enhanced)
- **API routes**: `/src/app/api/auth/` (BetterAuth integration)

### Technical Constraints
Enhanced beyond original requirements:
- Next.js 15.5.3 with App Router compatibility [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- BetterAuth 1.3.13 for modern authentication [Source: 2.1 implementation]
- Dual authentication system (BetterAuth + legacy JWT) [Source: 2.2 implementation]
- TypeScript strict mode compliance [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Enhanced security with scrypt hashing [Source: BetterAuth features]

### Testing Standards
Comprehensive testing implemented: [Source: 2.3 testing implementation]
- Authentication flow tests with React Testing Library
- Backend API endpoint testing with Jest
- Session management and persistence testing
- Error handling and edge case validation
- Integration tests for complete authentication flows
