# Story 1.3: User Signup

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to be able to sign up for a new account using my email and password,
**so that** I can start using the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A user can submit their email and password via a signup form.
2. A new entry is created in the `users` table with a hashed password.
3. Upon successful signup, the user is automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard.
4. The system prevents duplicate email signups.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create Signup API Endpoint (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Create `POST /api/auth/signup` endpoint
  - [ ] Implement email validation and duplicate checking
  - [ ] Hash password using bcrypt or similar secure method
  - [ ] Insert new user record into `users` table with UUID
  - [ ] Return appropriate success/error responses

- [ ] Task 2: Create Signup Form UI (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create signup page component with form fields (email, password, confirm password)
  - [ ] Add form validation for email format and password requirements
  - [ ] Implement form submission handling with API integration
  - [ ] Add loading states and error message display
  - [ ] Style form using Tailwind CSS for consistent design

- [ ] Task 3: Implement Auto-login and Redirect (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Generate JWT token after successful signup
  - [ ] Set authentication state in the frontend
  - [ ] Redirect user to dashboard page after successful signup
  - [ ] Handle session management for newly created user

- [ ] Task 4: Create Minimal Dashboard Page (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create basic dashboard page at `/dashboard` route
  - [ ] Add welcome message and user greeting
  - [ ] Include basic layout structure for future enhancements
  - [ ] Style with Tailwind CSS matching application theme
  - [ ] Add placeholder sections for future dashboard features

- [ ] Task 5: Add Comprehensive Testing
  - [ ] Write unit tests for signup API endpoint
  - [ ] Test email validation and duplicate prevention
  - [ ] Test password hashing functionality
  - [ ] Create frontend component tests for signup form
  - [ ] Test auto-login flow and redirection to dashboard

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements user registration functionality for the **AI Personal Finance Tracker SaaS** WebApp. It establishes the foundation for user authentication and account management that will support all subsequent user-specific features.

[Source: docs/architecture/1-system-overview.md]

### Previous Story Insights
- Database schema is established with `users` table containing proper UUID primary keys
- Direct Supabase integration is configured and working via MCP
- Environment variables are properly set up for database connections
- Project structure includes `src/lib/database.ts` for database client operations
- Alternative implementation approach (direct SQL vs ORM) has been validated

### Database Schema Requirements
**Users Table Structure:**
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key) - Auto-generated
- `email` (String, Unique) - User's email address
- `password_hash` (String) - Securely hashed password
- `created_at` (DateTime) - Account creation timestamp
[Source: docs/architecture/3-database-schema.md#users]

### API Specifications
**Authentication Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - User registration endpoint
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login endpoint (future story)
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout endpoint (future story)
[Source: docs/architecture/4-api-endpoints-backend-frontend.md#auth]

### Security Requirements
- **JWT Auth Tokens** for session management
- **Password hashing** using secure algorithms (bcrypt recommended)
- **Email validation** to prevent invalid registrations
- **Duplicate prevention** to maintain email uniqueness
- **HTTPS enforcement** for secure data transmission
[Source: docs/architecture/6-security-privacy.md]

### Frontend Architecture
- **Next.js** framework with React components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design
- **Form validation** for user input handling
- **Loading states** and error handling for better UX
[Source: docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#frontend-webapp]

### File Locations
- API routes: `src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` (Next.js 13+ App Router)
- Signup page: `src/app/signup/page.tsx`
- Dashboard page: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (minimal landing page)
- Database client: `src/lib/database.ts` (already established)
- Authentication utilities: `src/lib/auth.ts` (to be created)

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for API endpoint functionality
- Integration tests for database operations
- Frontend component testing for form behavior
- End-to-end testing for complete signup flow
- Password security validation testing

### Technical Constraints
- Use Next.js 15 with App Router structure
- Implement secure password hashing (never store plain text passwords)
- Follow PostgreSQL data types compatible with Supabase
- Maintain consistency with existing Tailwind CSS styling
- Use direct Supabase client for database operations
- Create minimal dashboard page as interim solution until Epic 4 implementation

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- API endpoint testing with various input scenarios
- Database integration testing with actual Supabase connection
- Frontend form validation testing
- Security testing for password handling
- User flow testing from signup to dashboard redirect
