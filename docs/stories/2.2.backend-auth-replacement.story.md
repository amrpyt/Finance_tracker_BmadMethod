# Story 2.2: Replace Backend Authentication System

## Status
Done
## Story
**As a** backend developer,
**I want** to replace the custom JWT authentication routes with BetterAuth handlers and migrate password hashing to BetterAuth's secure implementation,
**so that** users can authenticate through BetterAuth's secure system while maintaining backward compatibility during the transition.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Custom JWT auth routes are replaced with BetterAuth handler endpoints
2. Password hashing is migrated from bcryptjs to BetterAuth's scrypt implementation
3. Session management uses BetterAuth's secure session handling
4. Existing user passwords are migrated to new format on next login
5. Dual authentication support during transition period (gradual migration)
6. All existing authentication functionality works seamlessly with BetterAuth
7. API response formats remain consistent for frontend compatibility

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Implement BetterAuth Route Handler Integration (AC: 1, 6)
  - [x] Update existing auth API structure to coexist with BetterAuth
  - [x] Configure BetterAuth handler to handle all authentication endpoints
  - [x] Create middleware to route authentication requests appropriately
  - [x] Test endpoint compatibility and response formats

- [x] Task 2: Migrate Password Hashing System (AC: 2, 4)
  - [x] Create password migration utility for bcrypt to scrypt conversion
  - [x] Implement gradual password migration on user login
  - [x] Add password migration status tracking for users
  - [x] Update password validation to support both bcrypt and scrypt during transition

- [x] Task 3: Replace Session Management (AC: 3, 5)
  - [x] Replace JWT session creation with BetterAuth session management
  - [x] Update session validation middleware to use BetterAuth
  - [x] Implement session migration for existing JWT tokens
  - [x] Configure BetterAuth session settings to match current 7-day expiration

- [x] Task 4: Implement Dual Authentication Support (AC: 5, 7)
  - [x] Create authentication strategy selector (legacy JWT vs BetterAuth)
  - [x] Implement user migration flag system
  - [x] Update authentication middleware to handle both systems
  - [x] Ensure API response consistency across both authentication methods

- [x] Task 5: Backend Authentication Testing and Validation (AC: 6, 7)
  - [x] Create comprehensive authentication endpoint tests
  - [x] Test password migration flow with real user scenarios
  - [x] Validate session management and expiration handling
  - [x] Test authentication middleware with both legacy and BetterAuth users

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.1 completed the BetterAuth infrastructure setup:
- BetterAuth configuration created with PostgreSQL adapter [Source: 2.1 completion notes]
- Database migration scripts prepared for BetterAuth tables [Source: 2.1 file list]
- Environment variables configured for BetterAuth [Source: 2.1 completion notes]
- Test suite established with 94% pass rate [Source: 2.1 Dev Agent Record]

### Data Models
Current authentication data structures: [Source: docs/architecture/3-database-schema.md#users]
```sql
users (current):
- id (UUID, PK)
- email (string)
- password_hash (bcrypt)
- created_at (timestamp)

user (BetterAuth - from Story 2.1):
- id (UUID, PK) 
- email (string)
- name (string)
- emailVerified (boolean)
- createdAt (timestamp)
- updatedAt (timestamp)

session (BetterAuth):
- id (string, PK)
- userId (UUID, FK)
- token (string, unique)
- expiresAt (timestamp)
- ipAddress (string)
- userAgent (string)
```

### API Specifications
Current authentication endpoints to replace: [Source: docs/architecture/4-api-endpoints-backend-frontend.md]
- `POST /api/auth/signup` → Replace with BetterAuth signup
- `POST /api/auth/login` → Replace with BetterAuth signin  
- `POST /api/auth/logout` → Replace with BetterAuth logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` → Replace with BetterAuth session check

BetterAuth endpoints: [Source: BetterAuth documentation from Story 2.1]
- `POST /api/auth/better-auth/sign-up` → BetterAuth signup handler
- `POST /api/auth/better-auth/sign-in` → BetterAuth signin handler
- `POST /api/auth/better-auth/sign-out` → BetterAuth logout handler
- `GET /api/auth/better-auth/session` → BetterAuth session handler

### Component Specifications
Authentication middleware updates: [Source: existing auth implementation analysis]
- Current: JWT verification in `src/lib/auth.ts` with `verifyJWT()`
- Target: BetterAuth session validation with `auth.api.getSession()`
- Migration: Dual support for both JWT and BetterAuth sessions

Password hashing migration: [Source: existing auth.ts and BetterAuth docs]
- Current: bcryptjs with 12 salt rounds
- Target: BetterAuth scrypt implementation
- Strategy: Gradual migration on login with user tracking

### File Locations
Based on Next.js App Router structure: [Source: project structure analysis from Story 2.1]
- BetterAuth handler: `/src/app/api/auth/[...better-auth]/route.ts` (exists from Story 2.1)
- Legacy auth routes: `/src/app/api/auth/{signup,login,logout,me}/route.ts` (existing)
- Auth utilities: `/src/lib/auth.ts` (update for dual support)
- Migration utilities: `/src/lib/auth-migration.ts` (new)
- Middleware: `/src/middleware.ts` (new/update)

### Technical Constraints
- Next.js 15.5.3 compatibility required [Source: finance-tracker/package.json]
- Must maintain Supabase PostgreSQL integration [Source: Story 2.1 setup]
- Backward compatibility during transition period
- No breaking changes to existing API response formats
- Session continuity for existing users

### Testing

### Testing Standards
Testing requirements based on existing patterns: [Source: Story 2.1 testing approach]
- Test file location: `src/__tests__/auth/` directory
- Use Jest testing framework with TypeScript support
- Integration tests for authentication flows
- API endpoint testing for both legacy and BetterAuth
- Password migration testing with sample data
- Session management compatibility testing

Specific testing requirements for this story:
- Authentication endpoint compatibility tests
- Password migration flow validation
- Session handling for both JWT and BetterAuth tokens
- Dual authentication system integration tests
- API response format consistency validation
- Error handling and edge case testing
