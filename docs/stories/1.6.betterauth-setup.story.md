# Story 1.6: Setup BetterAuth Infrastructure and Database Migration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to set up BetterAuth infrastructure and migrate the database schema to support BetterAuth requirements,
**so that** the application can use BetterAuth's secure authentication system instead of our custom JWT implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. BetterAuth is installed and configured with Supabase adapter
2. Database schema is extended with BetterAuth required tables and fields
3. Environment variables are configured for BetterAuth secrets and settings
4. BetterAuth server configuration is created and tested
5. Existing user data remains intact and accessible
6. Database migration is backward compatible with rollback capability

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Install BetterAuth Dependencies (AC: 1)
  - [x] Install `better-auth` core package via npm
  - [x] Install PostgreSQL adapter (pg) for BetterAuth database integration
  - [x] Install TypeScript types and development dependencies
  - [x] Update package.json with new dependencies

- [x] Task 2: Configure Environment Variables (AC: 3)
  - [x] Generate secure BETTER_AUTH_SECRET using BetterAuth CLI
  - [x] Set up BETTER_AUTH_URL for development and production environments
  - [x] Configure Supabase connection variables for BetterAuth
  - [x] Update .env.example with new required variables

- [x] Task 3: Create Database Migration Scripts (AC: 2, 5, 6)
  - [x] Generate BetterAuth database schema manually (CLI had connection issues)
  - [x] Create migration script to add BetterAuth tables (user, session, account, verification)
  - [x] Create backup script for existing user data
  - [x] Create rollback script to remove BetterAuth tables
  - [x] Create automated migration and validation scripts

- [x] Task 4: Set Up BetterAuth Server Configuration (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Create auth-betterauth.ts configuration file with PostgreSQL adapter
  - [x] Configure email and password authentication settings
  - [x] Set up session management and cookie configurations
  - [x] Configure security settings (CSRF, rate limiting)
  - [x] Create development testing endpoint for auth verification

- [x] Task 5: Data Migration Strategy (AC: 5)
  - [x] Analyze existing user table structure vs BetterAuth requirements
  - [x] Create data mapping strategy for existing users
  - [x] Plan password hash migration approach (bcrypt to scrypt)
  - [x] Create user data validation scripts
  - [x] Document migration rollback procedures

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous BetterAuth stories exist. This is the foundational story for the authentication migration epic. Key learnings from existing auth implementation:
- Current system uses JWT with 7-day expiration [Source: finance-tracker/src/lib/auth.ts]
- Password hashing uses bcryptjs with 12 salt rounds [Source: finance-tracker/src/lib/auth.ts]
- Session management via HTTP-only cookies [Source: finance-tracker/src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts]

### Data Models
Current user table structure: [Source: docs/architecture/3-database-schema.md#users]
```sql
users:
- id (UUID, PK)
- email (string)
- password_hash (string)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

BetterAuth will extend this with additional tables:
- `user` table (maps to existing users)
- `session` table for session management
- `account` table for social login providers (future use)
- `verification` table for email verification

### API Specifications
Current authentication endpoints to be replaced: [Source: docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#backend-api-layer]
- `POST /api/auth/signup` → BetterAuth handler
- `POST /api/auth/login` → BetterAuth handler  
- `POST /api/auth/logout` → BetterAuth handler
- `GET /api/auth/me` → BetterAuth session endpoint

### File Locations
Based on Next.js project structure:
- Auth configuration: `/src/lib/auth.ts` (replace existing)
- Environment variables: `.env.local` and `.env.example`
- Database migrations: `/scripts/migrations/` (new directory)
- Auth API handler: `/src/app/api/auth/[...better-auth]/route.ts` (new)

### Technical Constraints
- Next.js 15.5.3 compatibility required [Source: finance-tracker/package.json]
- Must maintain Supabase PostgreSQL integration [Source: docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#database]
- TypeScript support mandatory
- Row-Level Security (RLS) must be preserved [Source: docs/architecture/6-security-privacy.md]

### Testing

### Testing Standards
Testing requirements based on existing patterns:
- Test file location: `src/__tests__/` directory structure
- Use Jest testing framework with TypeScript support
- Create integration tests for database migration
- Unit tests for auth configuration
- API endpoint testing for BetterAuth handler
- Session management testing
- Database rollback testing

Specific testing requirements for this story:
- Migration script validation tests
- BetterAuth configuration verification
- Database schema integrity tests
- Environment variable validation
- Rollback procedure testing
