## 1. Goals & Background Context

* **Ease of Input**: Allow users to log transactions effortlessly with a single sentence, a voice note, or a receipt photo.
* **Automated Categorization**: Leverage AI to automatically classify transactions by type and category.
* **Multi-Account Tracking**: Enable users to add and manage multiple financial accounts (bank, cash, credit cards, etc.).
* **Lightweight Experience**: Focus on simplicity and core functionality, avoiding the complexity of traditional finance apps.

The **AI Personal Finance Tracker** is a SaaS WebApp that helps users monitor their income and expenses simply. Instead of tedious manual entry, users can write, speak, or upload a receipt. The system uses AI (STT, LLM, OCR) to automatically extract and process these transactions, providing a frictionless financial tracking experience.

## 2. Requirements

### ## Functional
1.  **Text Input**: Users can input transactions via text in both Arabic and English.
2.  **Voice Input**: Users can record their voice to create a transaction, which is processed by an STT service (`POST /stt/transcribe/`).
3.  **Receipt Image Input**: Users can upload a receipt image, which is processed by an OCR service (`POST /images/edit/`).
4.  **AI Transaction Extraction**: All inputs (text, voice, image) are processed by an LLM service (`POST /text/llm/`) to extract transaction details.
5.  **Multi-Account Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete multiple financial accounts. Each transaction must be linked to an account.
6.  **Dashboard**: The application must provide a dashboard displaying total balance, balance per account, recent transactions, and data visualizations (charts).
7.  **User Authentication**: The system will support user authentication via Email/Password and Google OAuth.
8.  **SaaS Tiers**: The application will have a Free Tier and a Pro Tier with billing managed by Stripe.

### ## Non-Functional
1.  **AI Accuracy**: The AI extraction process must achieve at least 90% accuracy in correctly identifying transaction details.
2.  **Privacy**: All user data must be encrypted and stored securely.
3.  **Multi-language Support**: The UI must support both Arabic and English from the initial launch.
4.  **Responsive WebApp**: The application must function correctly on all modern web browsers.

## 3. User Interface Design Goals

* **Chat-like Interface**: The primary input method will be a simple, conversational interface similar to WhatsApp or Telegram.
* **Account Selection**: A dropdown menu will be available for users to select the relevant account when adding a transaction.
* **Dashboard Cards**: The dashboard will use a card-based layout to display the balance for each account, plus a total balance card.
* **Visual Modes**: Both Light and Dark modes will be supported.

## 4. Epic & Story Structure
