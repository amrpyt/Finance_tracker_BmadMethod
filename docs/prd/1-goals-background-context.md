The **AI Personal Finance Tracker** is a SaaS WebApp that helps users monitor their income and expenses simply. Instead of tedious manual entry, users can write, speak, or upload a receipt. The system uses AI (STT, LLM, OCR) to automatically extract and process these transactions, providing a frictionless financial tracking experience.
