# Epic 3: AI-Powered Transaction Input - Core AI Integration

## Epic Goal

Integrate the key AI services (STT, LLM, OCR) to enable users to automatically create transactions from plain text, voice recordings, and receipt images, transforming the Finance Tracker into an AI-powered financial assistant.

## Epic Description

### Current System Context:

- **Current relevant functionality:** Manual transaction creation via forms, basic CRUD operations for transactions and accounts, user authentication with BetterAuth, Supabase PostgreSQL database
- **Technology stack:** Next.js 15.5.3, React 19, TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL), BetterAuth, Tailwind CSS
- **Integration points:** Transaction API endpoints (`/api/transactions`), account management system, user authentication context, existing transaction types and categories

### Enhancement Details:

- **What's being added/changed:** 
  - Integration with internal AI APIs: STT (`POST /stt/transcribe/`), LLM (`POST /text/llm/`), OCR (`POST /images/edit/`)
  - New chat-style interface for AI-powered transaction input
  - Multi-modal input support: text, voice, and receipt image processing
  - AI transaction confirmation and editing workflow
  - Enhanced transaction creation pipeline with AI extraction

- **How it integrates:** 
  - AI services will process user inputs and return structured transaction data
  - Existing transaction creation API will be extended to handle AI-extracted data
  - New UI components for chat interface, voice recording, and image upload
  - AI confirmation workflow will integrate with existing transaction validation
  - Maintains compatibility with existing manual transaction creation

- **Success criteria:** 
  - Users can create transactions via natural language text input with 90%+ accuracy
  - Voice-to-transaction workflow processes audio and creates accurate transactions
  - Receipt image processing extracts transaction details with 85%+ accuracy
  - AI-extracted transactions integrate seamlessly with existing account and category systems
  - User experience is intuitive and faster than manual entry for most use cases

## Stories

1. **Story 3.1:** Transaction Creation via Simple Text Input
   - Implement chat interface with text input for natural language transaction creation
   - Integrate with LLM API to extract transaction details from user text
   - Create transaction draft and confirmation workflow
   - Handle edge cases and validation for AI-extracted data

2. **Story 3.2:** Transaction Creation via Voice Input
   - Add voice recording capability to chat interface
   - Integrate with STT API to transcribe audio to text
   - Process transcribed text through existing LLM pipeline
   - Implement voice recording UI/UX with proper feedback

3. **Story 3.3:** Transaction Creation via Receipt Upload
   - Implement image upload functionality in chat interface
   - Integrate with OCR API to extract text from receipt images
   - Process extracted text through LLM for transaction details
   - Handle image processing errors and validation

4. **Story 3.4:** AI Transaction Confirmation UI
   - Create confirmation modal for AI-extracted transaction details
   - Allow users to edit and validate AI-extracted data before saving
   - Implement smart defaults and category suggestions
   - Ensure seamless integration with existing transaction creation flow

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing manual transaction creation must remain fully functional
- [ ] AI-created transactions must follow same validation rules as manual transactions
- [ ] Account and category systems must work seamlessly with AI-extracted data
- [ ] Performance impact should be minimal for users not using AI features
- [ ] API response formats maintain consistency with existing transaction endpoints

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** AI service dependencies and accuracy issues
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Implement robust error handling and fallback to manual entry
  - Add comprehensive validation for AI-extracted data
  - Create monitoring and logging for AI service performance
  - Implement progressive enhancement (AI features enhance but don't replace manual entry)
- **Rollback Plan:** 
  - Feature flags to disable AI functionality if needed
  - Graceful degradation to manual transaction entry
  - API versioning to maintain backward compatibility
  - User notification system for AI service outages

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Users can create transactions via text, voice, and image inputs
- [ ] AI extraction accuracy meets specified thresholds (90% text, 85% OCR)
- [ ] Confirmation workflow allows users to validate and edit AI-extracted data
- [ ] No regression in existing manual transaction functionality
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show acceptable response times for AI operations
- [ ] Error handling covers all AI service failure scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated for new AI-powered features

## Epic Status: ðŸš§ PLANNING

**Start Date:** 2025-09-23  
**Target Completion:** TBD  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 developer days

## Validation Checklist

### Scope Validation:
- [ ] Epic can be completed in 4 stories maximum
- [ ] AI service integration complexity is manageable
- [ ] Enhancement follows established Next.js and React patterns
- [ ] Integration with existing transaction system is well-defined

### Risk Assessment:
- [ ] Risk to existing system is low (additive functionality)
- [ ] AI service dependencies are documented and monitored
- [ ] Testing approach covers AI accuracy and error scenarios
- [ ] Team has sufficient knowledge of AI API integration

### Completeness Check:
- [ ] Epic goal is clear and achievable
- [ ] Stories are properly scoped and sequential
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Dependencies identified (AI APIs, existing transaction system)

## Technical Context

### AI Service Integration:
- **STT Service:** `POST /stt/transcribe/` - Converts audio to text
- **LLM Service:** `POST /text/llm/` - Extracts transaction details from text
- **OCR Service:** `POST /images/edit/` - Extracts text from receipt images

### Expected AI Response Format:
```typescript
interface AITransactionExtraction {
  amount: number
  type: 'income' | 'expense'
  category: string
  description: string
  date?: string
  confidence: number
  extractedFields: {
    merchant?: string
    location?: string
    paymentMethod?: string
  }
}
```

### Integration Architecture:
- **Frontend:** React components for chat interface, voice recording, image upload
- **API Layer:** Next.js API routes for AI service communication
- **Processing Pipeline:** Text â†’ LLM â†’ Transaction Draft â†’ User Confirmation â†’ Database
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback to manual entry on AI service failures

## Handoff to Story Manager

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this AI-Powered Transaction Input epic. Key considerations:

- This builds upon the completed Epic 2 (Core Financial Management) with existing transaction CRUD operations
- Integration points: Existing transaction API, account management, user authentication context
- AI services are external dependencies that require robust error handling and validation
- Each story must maintain compatibility with existing manual transaction creation
- Focus on user experience that makes AI input faster and more intuitive than manual entry
- Critical requirement: AI accuracy thresholds must be met for production readiness

The epic should deliver a seamless AI-powered transaction creation experience while maintaining system reliability and user control over their financial data."
